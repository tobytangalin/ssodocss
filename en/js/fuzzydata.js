"body" : "Describes how to set up an SAML SSO connection in the Sitecore Cloud Portal. Before you begin You must be an Organization Admin or Organization Owner in your Sitecore Cloud Portal organization. You must have the ability to register Sitecore Cloud Portal with your identity provider (IdP). Your IdP must support SAML 1.1 or SAML 2.0. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open security standard for managing authentication and access. SAML for single sign-on allows team members to log in to the Sitecore Cloud Portal using their existing SAML identity provider. Sitecore supports service provider (SP) initiated SAML . Sitecore does not support just-in-time (JIT) provisioning, single logout (SLO), request signing, or response encryption. In SAML single sign-on setup (SSO), there are two main entities: Service provider (SP) - The app or website that a user wants to access. In our case, Sitecore Cloud Portal is the SP. Identity provider (IdP) - The entity that stores user information and credentials and provides authentication. Popular IdPs include Microsoft Entra and Okta . To allow team members to log in using an SAML identity provider, you need to configure SAML SSO. When setting up SAML SSO, you'll need SP metadata to configure your IdP and you'll need IdP metadata to configure your SSO connection. Sitecore generates the the SP metadata when you add a new connection. Your IdP usually generates the IdP metadata when you create a SAML app to register Sitecore Cloud Portal with your IdP. Before enabling an SSO connection, we highly recommend reading about what happens when you enable SSO . This walkthrough describes how to: Add a SAML SSO connection in the Sitecore Cloud Portal Register Sitecore Cloud Portal with your SAML identity provider Configure your SSO connection Configure your identity provider Map Sitecore attributes to your identity provider's SAML attributes Verify domain Test connection Enable " },

"body" : "If your Identity provider's SAML response includes email , family_name , and given_name , no further configuration is required and you can test the SSO connection now. When a user tries to log in, Sitecore Cloud Portal expects the email , given_name , and family_name attributes in your IdP's SAML response. If your IdP's SAML response does not include the email attribute, your SSO connection will fail. If the SAML response does not include family_name and given_name , your team members might have missing details in the Sitecore Cloud Portal. Identity providers might have different names for these attributes or not provide them by default. Attributes are case-sensitive. If your IdP's SAML response does not include an expected attribute or has an attribute that provides the wrong information, you need to modify your identity providerâ€™s SAML response to include the expected attributes by configuring attribute mapping within your identity provider. Example: Okta If your IdP does not support attribute mapping and uses a different attribute name for the same information (for example emailAddress instead of email ), you can use the Attribute mapping section of the SSO connection config to define the IdP SAML attribute that matches the Sitecore attribute. Sitecore attribute Map to IdP attribute name Priority email User's email. Required given_name User's given name(s) or first name(s). Optional family_name User's surname(s) or last name(s). name User's full name. Nice to have nickname User's nickname or casual name. " },
